# rawdog

rawdog is a lean, dependency-free* Swift package created to simplify and expedite the binary encoding and decoding process for programming objects.

the primary utility of this library comes in its ability to express statically allocated memoryspace, while automatically handling alignment, endianness, and initialization to and from other types.

in c, the following syntax is common and efficient `uint8_t[1024]`. in swift, trying to achieve a similar result (unaligned memory allocations with static length) is a nightmare....tuple literals are radically more verbose and notably less flexable than the c equivalent in syntax. this is the swift-specific problem that rawdog solves and builds on, while maintaining a rational but powerful pattern around type strictness and memory safety that Swift syntax is known for.

## Documentation 

I'm really happy with the structure and clarity of the code itself but documentation coverage is incomplete.

## Crypto

rawdog distributes and builds its own source material (in c) for all cryptographic functions, including:

- blake2 hashing (keyed and unkeyed in all variants)
- SHA1,256,512 hashing
- MD5 hashing
- ed25519 signature scheme
- curve25519 keys
- bcrypt blowfish password hashing
- chachapoly AEAD
- argon2 KDF

these sources come with a complete suite of tests that tested to pass on x86 and ARM, macOS and Linux. the code is also expected to handle endianness natively, although admittedly I do not have the means of verifying the
